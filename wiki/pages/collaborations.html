                        Through the communication platform of the iGEM Chinese community, we received the exchange
                        invitation of HUBU-China, which opened a happy exchange. This year, HUBU-China's project is to
                        use plasmid delivery of RNAi to control agricultural pests efficiently. The excellent targeting
                        performance of RNAi can avoid the non-specific killing of other organisms, and its instability
                        also reduces the risk of environmental exposure. This made us realize that our project also
                        needs to consider biosafety issues and environmental exposure risks more comprehensively. In
                        addition, we shared our views on how to gain special prizes, coming away with a renewable
                        understanding of how we can improve our project.

                        From July 11 to 14, 2024, we were invited to Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University to attend the
                        11th iGEMer Exchange Conference in China. Excellent iGEM teams from all over the country
                        gathered at the conference. We interacted with Hainan-China, WHU-China, HUBU-China,
                        Jiangnan-China and other teams to learn more about their creative design concepts, such as the
                        selection of lytic protein. During communication, we received valuable suggestions from other
                        teams and professors in various fields, such as on the properties of hydrogels under high heavy
                        metal ion concentrations, prompting us to reflect on the rationality of using hydrogels in
                        industry and actively explore new improvement schemes.

                        After CCiC, we exchanged contact information with interested teams. We launched an online
                        exchange on human practice with Hainan-China and NJTech-China. By sharing our experiences and
                        plans from human practice, we gained a deeper insight into the relationship between the world
                        and our project.

                        The representatives of Hainan University highlighted their experiences of regular communication
                        and cooperation with professors and enterprises, which enabled them to orient their project
                        direction more accurately. The Nanjing University of Technology team members presented a
                        publicity campaign designed for visually and hearing-impaired people, perfectly demonstrating
                        the team's humanistic care and social responsibility. We shared some examples of how human
                        practice helped us make design decisions logically and explained how human practice ran through
                        the whole life cycle of our project.

                        visions for the future of human practice, which made us feel more intensely the close connection
                        between ourselves and the world.
