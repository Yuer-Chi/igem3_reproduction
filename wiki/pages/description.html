                        As Mr. Gorky said, “Books are the ladder of human progress.” Books not only record and spread knowledge but also provide readers with the opportunity to gain insights and experiences from scholars, thereby extending intellectual ideologies. As one of the Four Great Inventions of ancient China, paper has served as a vital carrier of knowledge, spreading across the world via the Silk Road, fostering economic and cultural exchanges among nations, and promoting human progress. With the advancement of civilization and technology, paper’s applications have expanded to packaging, cleaning, decorating, and writing. Unfortunately, the rapid population growth has driven heavy demands for paper, leading to extensive deforestation and disturbing the ecological balance, thereby exacerbating the climate crisis. Enhancing the recycling of waste paper can mitigate deforestation, offering a significant contribution to addressing the climate crisis. Inspired by this, our project aims to investigate the current state and challenges of waste paper recycling, provide innovative solutions to the recycling bottleneck, and raise public awareness about resource recycling and the climate crisis.

                        The ongoing climate crisis driven by high levels of <b>greenhouse gas (GHG)</b> emissions has led to numerous
                        disasters and heavy losses worldwide. Climate-related disasters, such as hurricanes, droughts,
                        floods and wildfires, have become increasingly frequent and severe over the years. These result
                        in significant economic losses and substantial human casualties, reaching nearly $143 billion
                        annually and approximately 60,951 deaths in the last 20 years (1). The root cause of
                        these
                        crises is the increase GHG like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous
                        oxide,
                        which contribute to global warming.

                        Forests act as <b>carbon sinks</b>, absorbing GHG and mitigate climate change. However,
                        with the rapid development of human society and the explosive growth of the population, the rate
                        of deforestation far exceeds the rate at which forests can grow. Each year, approximately 4.7
                        million hectares of forest are lost globally (2).

                        Paper promotes the development of human civilization, but the manufacturing process of paper
                        causes significant pollution. Featuring the extensive use of virgin wood, the pulp and paper
                        industry not only causes deforestation but also generate huge amount of GHG in
                        material processing. From 1961 to 2019, the pulp and paper industry generated 43.5 billion tons
                        of carbon dioxide, accounting for 4.2% of global anthropogenic GHG emissions (3). If much of the
                        paper can be recycled, it can greatly reduce the cutting down of trees and alleviate the climate
                        crisis.

                        According to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Recycling one ton of paper can save
                        approximately 17 trees, 7,000 gallons of water, and 4,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity (4).
                        Therefore, paper recycling not only conserves natural resources but also reduces the
                        environmental footprint. Despite the importance of paper recycling, traditional methods pose
                        severe environmental challenges. The deinking process consumes large amount of water and
                        chemicals such as sodium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide and chlorine-based bleach. Moreover, the
                        sludge from deinking contains heavy metals and toxic chemicals. It releases carbon dioxide and
                        various toxic gases when incinerated and contaminates soil and water if landfilled. This
                        underscores the necessity for innovative methods that enhance recycling efficiency and minimize
                        pollution.

                        As one of the large-scale manufacturing industries in the world, the pulp and paper industry not
                        only contributes to the rapid development of modern technology and society's progress but also
                        exerts a significant adverse impact on forests, the water environment, and, ultimately, the
                        climate. Around 405 million tons of paper and paperboard are produced annually, accounting for
                        13-15% of total wood consumption. With the demand for paper products increasing, global
                        production could double by 2050 (5). If waste paper is not recycled, 240 million tons of paper
                        will end up becoming landfill waste or being incinerated, equivalent to a loss of 408 thousand
                        hectares of forests (6).

                        produced is recycled, and the utilization rate for waste paper has been declining over the
                        years, dropping from 72.2% in 2013 to 53.5% in 2022 (Figure 1). Such figures indicate that a
                        significant portion of waste paper resources is underutilized in China.

                        (1) High cost: Plenty of water and chemical reagents were used to deal with the ink in waste
                        paper, and the effluent treatment also cost many processing fees.

                    <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
                        The first step of the waste paper recycling process was pulping, in which the sorted paper was
                        mixed with water and chemicals and subsequently stirred into fibers. Then, the pulp undergoes
                        alkaline deinking (8), flotation and washing process to remove the ink. Because the alkaline
                        treatment diminishes the brightness and whiteness of the pulp (9), the deinked pulp is typically
                        subjected to bleaching. Traditional bleaching methods often use chlorine-based chemicals, such
                        as chlorine and hypochlorite, which will produce harmful chlorinated organic compounds. At last,
                        in terms of heavy metals present in post-deinking wastewater, these substances tend to settle
                        into the sludge after wastewater treatments. The sludge is then incinerated or landfilled, which
                        poses significant risks to the air and soil (10).

                    <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
                        In conclusion, this conventional approach demands a substantial amount of toxic chemicals. It
                        further results in the release of poisonous organic agents and heavy metals that may cause
                        environmental contamination. What's more, those substances involved in the deinking process
                        complicate wastewater and sludge treatment, necessitating additional procedures prior to
                        disposal.

                    <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
                        We conducted a series of investigations, visiting waste collectors, sorting stations, recycling
                        industry associations, and paper mills to research the issues of waste paper recycling. Our
                        findings revealed several significant challenges. The high cost associated with the recycling
                        process is a major concern, as a substantial amount of water and chemical reagents, such as
                        hydrogen peroxide and sodium hydroxide, are required to remove ink from waste paper. The
                        post-deinking effluent containing these chemicals necessitates further treatment, adding to the
                        overall expenses. Additionally, the use of chemical deinking agents and bleach poses significant
                        health risks to workers in the factory.
                    </p>
                    <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
                        Environmental pollution is another critical issue. The sludge generated during the recycling
                        process is usually incinerated or landfilled. These practices release harmful substances into the
                        air and soil, leading to severe environmental contamination.

                        fun activities, spreading the concept of recycling to both young and old. To gather public
                        opinions and attitudes towards paper recycling, we launched a comprehensive survey and it
                        provided valuable insights into current recycling habits and areas needing improvement. Lastly,
                        we published informative articles on social media, reaching a wide audience and encouraging
                        greater participation in recycling efforts (see <a style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: none;"

                        The heavy metal adsorbing bacteria may escape through the wastewater pipelines and cause genetic
                        contamination in the natural environment. So, we designed <b>a blue light-induced kill switch</b> in
                        <i>E. coli</i> to ensure biosafety (Figure 2). LexRO is a light-sensitive protein that forms a homodimer and
                        binds to pColE408 to repress gene expression in darkness. When exposed to blue light, LexRO                   dissociates, leading to the activation of gene expression. The circuit functions by the
                        LexRO-regulated expression of cytotoxic protein CcdB and anti-CcdB protein CcdA.

                        We've noticed that there is another factor barricading the sustainable development of paper
                        resources: the waste of paper products. In daily life, writing remains indispensable, yet it
                        inevitably involves error and leaves non-erasable marks. Our team has frequently noticed paper
                        wastage due to these unavoidable mistakes, which adversely affect the utilization rate of paper
                        and burden the process of recycling.

                        Stationery manufacturers have taken note of the need for pen mark erasure in daily use, leading
                        to the development of various erasure products like correction tapes, erasable pens, and
                        correction fluids. However, these products have their flaws considering effectiveness, safety,
                        and environmental impact. However, some obvious modification traces (abrasion or cover) are
                        inaesthetic and even unwarrantable for some important documents.

                        We tested several compounds and found their potential in pen mark removal. Rhamnolipids are
                        highly efficient biosurfactants that can form micelles in water, thereby enhancing the
                        solubility of ink. Limonene, a natural terpene compound, can also promote the solubility of ink.
                        Together, they facilitate the detachment and dissolution of ink particles.

                        Chitosan is a natural biopolymer derived from chitin. Cross-linking agent glutaraldehyde can
                        react with the amino groups on chitosan to form porous cross-linked chitosan with huge
                        adsorption capacity.

                        Our proposed solution for pen mark erasure in daily use leads to a user-friendly “eraser pen”.
                        This pen uses rhamnolipid and limonene as its “bio-ink” to dissolve pen marks and has a chitosan
                        bio-absorbent on its tail to absorb ink particles, has the potential to revolutionize the way we
                        use paper, sparking excitement and optimism about the future.

                        As climate change continues to accelerate, the need to preserve our forests has never been more
                        critical. Deforestation, driven by commercial purposes such as paper production, exacerbates
                        this issue by the destruction of vital carbon sinks. Paper recycling is an effective way to
                        protect the forests. However, separating ink and paper once they are combined is a significant
                        challenge. The difficulty in eliminating ink from paper hampers industrial waste paper
                        recycling. Moreover, the wastewater resulting from the deinking process contains high-level
                        heavy metals and various pollutants. These issues have guided our focus toward bio-deinking and
                        the detoxification of post-deinking wastewater this year.
