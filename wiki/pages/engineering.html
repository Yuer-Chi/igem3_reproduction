            This year, XMU-China focused on the optimization of industrial processes for 
            waste paper treatment and had made significant progress in this field 
            (See more details in our <a style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: none;"
            href="{{ url_for('pages', page='description') }}">Description</a> page). It is relatively easy to produce 
            target proteins by engineered bacteria and purify them in the laboratory, however 
            in industry, the additional purification process will greatly increase the cost 
            of paper recycling. During this season, some successful engineering iterations 
            for obtaining target proteins without the need of purification, particularly 
            using the <i>E. coli</i> autolytic system FLSA (FhuD-T7 lysozyme-SsrA mediated 
            autolytic system) in enzymes production and releasing, have been achieved. 
            All the related data are recorded below and we hope it will be helpful for 
            other iGEM teams and SynBio community if they meet the related issue of 
            obtaining recombinant proteins from microbial cell factories by means of 
            purification-free technology.

            In the autolytic system FLSA (FhuD-T7 lysozyme-SsrA mediated autolytic system), T7 lysozyme will reach the peptidoglycan layer in periplasmic space with the assistance of Sec-Tat dual pathway signal peptide FhuD to permeabilize the host inner membrane, resulting in the degradation of the peptidoglycan framework to cause cell collapse. While the degron, SsrA tag, was fused to the C-terminal of T7 lysozyme for alleviating the undesired lysis of host cells caused by leaking T7 lysozyme (1).

            For determining the efficiency of FLSA autolytic system to release 
            intracellularly produced recombinant proteins, we chose the superfolder green

            could be easily measured as fluorescence intensity. Therefore, the <b>sfGFP

            The original FLSA autolytic system (FhuD-GGG linker-T7 lysozyme 119V-SsrA) 
            suffered from low release efficiency. Since the T7 lysozyme plays a key role 
            in degrading the peptidoglycan framework to cause cell collapse, we then 
            focused on the sequence of T7 lysozyme we used in the experiments. In addition 
            to the amidase activity, the T7 lysozyme was identified to inhibit the T7 RNA 
            polymerase, thus regulating the transcription level of T7 promoter (4). 
            Therefore, a well-known plasmid, pLysS (<a style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: none;"
            href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/HB865373.1">GenBank: HB865373.1</a>), which contained 
            the coding sequence of T7 lysozyme, was constructed to improve the inducible 
            T7 expression system in <i>E. coli</i> BL21(DE3), especially for some toxic proteins 
            due to the lower leakage resulting from the inhibition of T7 RNA polymerase 
            (5). We then performed sequence alignment of the T7 lysozyme encoding on the 
            pLysS to the sequence we used (<a style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: none;"

            residue at the 119<sup>th</sup> site (Figure 3). Even though no evidence showed the 
            residue at this site will affect either the activity of amidase or inhibitor 
            of T7 RNA polymerase (6), we wonder whether the change at this site (V to G) 
            contribute to the improved release efficiency of FLSA autolytic system or not.

              to cause cell collapse, which implied that this change of a single residue 
              might promote the amidase activity of T7 lysozyme whereas the influence of 
              119<sup>th</sup> residue has not been reported. The effect of this site should be 
              further verified and the mechanism need to be explored in the future. However, 
              this improvement inspired us that other sequences in the FhuD-lysozyme-SsrA 
              fusion may also affect the efficiency of FLSA autolytic system. Given the case 
              of last season that the linker between signal peptide (Kpsp) and the cargo (GFP) 
              has an nonnegligible influence on the folding of cargo

              href="https://2023.igem.wiki/xmu-china/engineering">Engineering Success of XMU-China 2023</a>), we turned to investigate whether the change of linker between FhuD and T7 lysozyme will have a positive effect on improving the release efficiency or not.

              Changing the linker sequence between the signal peptide and recombinant protein to be secreted might affect both the folding of cargo and the secretion efficiency (8). Depending on the secretion pathway, useful machinery of protein-folding enhancers in the periplasm could be accessible (9). The dual-pathway signal peptide FhuD, possessing both Sec- and Tat- pathway properties, might help solve the folding issue of lysozymes (1). Anyway, the better-performed TSS linker contributes to the improvement of release efficiency of the FLSA autolytic system, even though the mechanism is elusive and need to be further investigated.

          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            For realizing the purification-free obtainment of target proteins, the deinking enzymes in our case, we implemented an autolytic system named FLSA (FhuD-T7 lysozyme-SsrA mediated autolytic system) to lysis the microbial cell factory after the target proteins are produced and accumulated. The original FLSA (FhuD-GGG Iinker-T7 lysozyme 119V-SsrA) suffered from low release efficiency. For optimizing the effect of FLSA system, we changed a single residue on the sequence of T7 lysozyme (V119G) to obtain an improved release efficiency from ~6% to ~15% at first. Then we replaced the linker between FhuD and T7 lysozyme with the one we used in 2020 and 2022 seasons, thus finally achieved a <b>considerable</b> release efficiency about 22% (Figure 8). This improved FLSA system will assist the release of deinking enzymes, offering a promising method for obtaining target proteins without purification, which is critical to lower the cost of paper recycling industry.
