                    environmentalists have adopted a more sensitive perspective on climate change in recent years and
                    how they have made efforts to protect forests. <br>

                    <b>“Are there any projects in the past few years that have impressed you or inspired you, especially
                      in forest conservation and the fight against climate change?”</b><br>
                    “One of our members was involved in a forest restoration project in a county in Fujian Province. The
                    forests there have been badly damaged by years of illegal logging, and flooding worsens it.
                    Thankfully, after several years of afforestation, the trees began to stabilize the soil.” <br>
                    <b>“From your perspective, what is the link between deforestation and global climate change? Does
                      deforestation exacerbate extreme weather events?”</b><br>
                    “We all know that deforestation is closely related to climate change. We're saying that forests are
                    important carbon absorbers, which can reduce GHG emissions, and slow down global warming. If you cut
                    down trees, you will increase the accumulation of greenhouse gases, leading to extreme weather. When
                    it comes to floods, droughts, typhoons, and so on, it is also closely related to deforestation to
                    some extent.”<br>
                    <b>“What do you think are the biggest challenges in promoting sustainable forest management and
                      conservation policies?”</b><br>
                    “Benefits. For many areas, deforestation means short-term economic gains. It takes time to convince
                    local communities of the long-term sustainability benefits, especially when the economic returns are
                    less obvious. So, when promoting these policies, it needs environmental awareness and corresponding
                    economic alternatives.”<br>
                    <b>Notion:</b><br>
                    Climate change is indeed linked to forests, and many people have been working on it continuously.
                    However, it is more important to make people gain the reward of these actions so that it can better
                    forest resource conservation.
                    In terms of spreading awareness of environmental conservation, these relevant organizations or
                    communities led by the young can spread the seeds of environmental protection to more people. <br>
                    <b>Decision:</b> <br>
                    To promote forest conservation, we need to learn more about how China is dealing with climate change
                    in forest utilization and try to turn our project into a viable economic alternative. In this
                    process, we also need to investigate further the public's understanding of paper products, which are
                    timber's main applications, helping carry out relevant science popularization activities.

                    <b>Will:</b><br>
                    From the interview with the Greenwild Association of XMU, we have acknowledged that deforestation is
                    a way of earning income for many areas. However, we think forests do more than that, so we want to
                    find out more about the global forest industry in the context of the climate crisis. <br>
                    <b>Action:</b><br>

                    We conducted an online interview with Prof. Liang. During the exchange, he introduced the concept of
                    forest ecosystem service and explained the ecological, economic, and social functions of forests. We
                    learned that the utilization types of forests in China can be divided into public welfare forests
                    and commercial forests. Public welfare forests mainly protect the ecological environment and
                    maintain biodiversity, while commercial forests pay more attention to economic benefits. However,
                    they are not opposites; they can be complementary and symbiotic through scientific management.<br>

                    With the aim of professionally evaluating the potential of our project as a promising economic
                    alternative for forest conservation, Prof. Liang recommended the <b>life cycle evaluation</b> method
                    for
                    us. This comprehensive approach will allow us to assess our project's impact on energy saving and
                    emission reduction in the paper industry, effectively bridging the gap between forestry and the
                    paper industry.<br>

                    <b>Notion:</b><br>
                    From our analysis of China's policies and the discussion with Prof. Liang, we have observed a
                    significant shift from industrial civilization to eco-civilization . This transition is a beacon of
                    hope for forest conservation. By employing the life cycle evaluation, we can measure our project's
                    contributions to reducing GHG emissions and protecting forest resources, thereby advancing the
                    implementation of this inspiring concept.<br>

                    <b>Decision:</b> <br>
                    We learned more about the changes in China's forestry policies and their implications for addressing
                    climate change. We decided to use a full <b>life cycle evaluation</b> to evaluate our project's
                    contributions to the paper industry and forest conservation.

                    we held discussions with the Zhangzhou Municipal Ecology and Environment Bureau. The staff told us
                    that Zhangzhou has been affected by global warming recently, with frequent extreme weather such as
                    typhoons, torrential rain, strong convection, drought, high temperature, and freezing damage.
                    Meteorological disasters are generally severe, affecting the city's economic operation.<br>

                    It is mentioned that carbon dioxide emission is the main cause of the greenhouse effect, deriving
                    from thermal power generation, paper making, steel, and other industrial activities that consume
                    large amounts of energy and materials. When it comes to the environmental impact of industry, we
                    learned that the current paper industry pollution mainly including ammonia nitrogen, total
                    phosphorus, black alkali liquor, organic pollutants, etc., which are troublesome for relevant
                    manufacturers. <br>

                    <b>Notion:</b><br>
                    After this survey, we realized we needed to find the details of paper enterprises' wastepaper
                    recycling and treatment processes. We also noticed that the Municipal Ecology and Environment Bureau
                    is also making efforts to create a low-carbon community in the local area. This urges us to pay
                    attention to the citizens and take subsequent actions.<br>

                    <b>Decision:</b> <br>
                    Through our discussions, we have gained a deeper understanding of climate change and have brought
                    attention to the carbon emission and pollution problems in the paper industry. This has also sparked
                    inspiration for us to conduct more extensive fieldwork on the potential for a low-carbon community.
                    We believe that we can make significant strides towards a more sustainable future.

                    We went to the Low-Value Recyclable Sorting Center in Xiamen to do research. Under the guidance of
                    Ms. Liu, an enterprise staff member at this center, we observed and experienced the sorting and
                    recycling processes on the spot. We found that most of the paper that entered the center had been
                    polluted, and it was difficult to reclassify precisely.<br>

                    The staff also said that the low-value mixed wastepaper could only be uniformly pulped and sent to
                    downstream enterprises for downgrade treatment, bringing minimal economic benefits.<br>

                    <b>Notion:</b><br>
                    We realized that improving paper recycling methods and expanding recycling ways can not only relieve
                    the burden on related enterprises but also turn trash into treasure, achieving sustainable
                    development of the paper industry.<br>

                    <b>Decision:</b> <br>
                    We found that wastepaper faces the problem of high sorting costs but low recycling value. This made
                    us plan relevant publicity work to raise residents' awareness of wastepaper sorting and recycling.
                    <br>

                    Meanwhile, we also have a deeper understanding of paper recycling, which is important to the
                    renewable resources industry and the city's waste treatment. So, we plan to conduct further research
                    on high-quality wastepaper resources entering the market.

                    We have learned about the paper industry's pollution problem and the difficulties of wastepaper
                    classification and recycling. To further investigate the production process and post-treatment
                    details of wastepaper recycling, we went to Nine Dragons Paper Company Limited in Quanzhou City for
                    a field investigation.<br>

                    The staff introduced the process of wastepaper recycling to us, which is mainly divided into pulp
                    and papermaking. Although it is more environmentally friendly than wood pulp paper, it is still a
                    relatively power-consuming process. The pulping and drying process consumes more electricity, which
                    means much coal. <br>

                    It is said if the wastepaper that has been recycled many times is reused. In that case, the fiber
                    treatment steps are more complicated, and the production efficiency is reduced, which is a common
                    problem faced by China's recycled paper industry. Moreover, because the raw materials of recycled
                    paper are generally waste office paper, the production process also needs to increase the bleaching
                    step, which not only consumes a lot of water and chemical reagents but also releases a variety of
                    pollutants, which will be harmful to the surrounding environment and bring adverse effects on the
                    health of workers without properly handled.<br>

                    While introducing the project, the staff did not quite understand the usage of engineered bacteria
                    in pulp making. They were worried that the metabolites of the bacteria themselves might adversely
                    affect the quality of the pulp. The sterilization equipment in the factory was generally ultraviolet
                    light or filter, which made it difficult to meet the needs of biosafety. So, the staff suggested
                    that we continue to improve the biosafety part.<br>

                    <b>Notion:</b><br>
                    The cumbersome fiber processing, the excessive use of chemical reagents, and the large processing
                    burden of wastewater are worthy of note, and these are the targets of our projects. To adapt to the
                    industry's specific situation, we also need to optimize our biosafety. <br>

                    <b>Decision:</b> <br>
                    Communication with the company allowed us to further clarify the specific processing difficulties of

                    <b>Action:</b><br>

                    The Store receives wastepaper from residents, scavengers, and sanitation workers, which can be up to
                    a total of 600 kilograms per day. After sorting by staff, the wastepaper is sent to a downstream
                    sorting center for compressing and packaging and finallydaixiu sold to paper mills for
                    reprocessing.<br>

                    <b>Notion:</b><br>
                    We observed that the amount of wastepaper in the recycling station is relatively stable and large,

                    of waste paper. To find out the real bottleneck of wastepaper recycling, we decided to seek relevant

                    We had an exchange with Ms. Zhang, Deputy Secretary-General of the Association. It is said that
                    different types of wastepaper will make differences in the degree of pollution and the purity of
                    fibers. For example, the low-value mixed wastepaper will cause pollution due to the printing ink,
                    adhesives, and other chemicals. This can increase the difficulty of recycling and affect the
                    efficiency of recovery and the quality of recycled paper.<br>

                    <b>Notion:</b><br>
                    Verified by many investigations, we finally found the reason for the low utilization of wastepaper:
                    the low deinking efficiency. To truly achieve efficient and eco-friendly wastepaper recycling, we
                    need to optimize the deinking step to overcome the problems of the high cost and low quality of
                    recycled paper.<br>

                    Through the investigation of wastepaper recycling in the market, we found that there are indeed
                    difficulties in industrial paper recycling, and the key to solving them may be optimizing the
                    deinking step. We also started to explore a more targeted scheme of synthetic biology.

                    paper, which hinders our de-inking process. So, we planned to use PETase and lipase to destroy the
                    ink binders. We want to know the feasibility of this strategy.<br>

                    We visited Prof. Yang and discussed the feasibility of our project with Prof. Yang. He said the
                    degradation of polymeric resin by enzymes is currently very inefficient. So, it is recommended that
                    we destroy the paper fibers in contact with ink to achieve the purpose of de-inking because
                    destroying a small amount of cellulose on the surface is easier.<br>

                    <b>Notion:</b><br>
                    These suggestions successfully made us start to pay attention to cellulase. So, when faced with a

                    During the experiments, we found that the de-inking effect of cellulase, lipase, and laccase was

                    find an alternative. <br>

                    It is said that the key to the pulp deinking may be related to using the oxidant, which is hydrogen
                    peroxide. So, he suggested that we try to use oxidase, such as monooxygenase. <br>

                    Prof. Chen explained to us that monooxygenase inserts a single oxygen atom in the process of
                    reacting with substrate molecules so that the conjugated side chains of lignin and other colored
                    substances. Finally, these colored substances become unstable, and ultimately achieve the purpose of
                    bleaching, which may be able to achieve the same or even better effect than hydrogen peroxide
                    treatment. This gives us a new idea for our processing system, more details can be found on our

                    </span><br> -->

                    In the initial design, we used a bacterial autolytic system called FLSA (FhuD-Lysozyme-SsrA Mediated
                    Autolytic System) for the effective release of intracellular products (Details in Design,
                    hyperlink). Prof. Zhuang expressed concerns about our autolytic system.<br>

                    Because we might inevitably cause leakage of our plasmids while cracking engineered bacteria without
                    safety measures. Moreover, if adding extra inducers to initiate autolysis is applied in an
                    industrial environment, the cost will be dramatically increased due to the large consumption of
                    inducers. <br>

                    To our surprise, Prof. Zhuang proposed a new idea – engineer the protein secretion ability of the
                    bacteria to achieve the goal of efficient enzyme release. Because the engineered bacteria can
                    release the enzyme continuously, rather than cracking it all at once. This inspired us to redesign
                    our project. <br>

                    Based on the experiments of LMT in 2021 XMU-China and 2023 XMU-China, we tried to compare the LMT
                    with the other seven signal peptides recommended by Ms. Zhuang. <br>

                    <b>Decision:</b> <br>
                    Through communication with Prof. Zhuang, we considered more details about the actual industrial
                    treatment scenarios. We re-examined our design from the perspective of efficiency and biosafety,
                    carrying out corresponding optimization, which made our deinking enzyme system more feasible and
                    reliable. Finally, we decided to use the LMT to secrete our enzymes. <br>

                    To improve the efficiency of the industrial de-inking process, we had a frank exchange with Prof.
                    Sha. When we introduced the project, we analyzed the industrial pulping process together with him,
                    including pulping, screening and purification, washing and concentration, de-inking flotation and
                    finally bleaching. Prof. Sha paid attention to the process of flotation. He explained to us that
                    flotation is an effective way to separate solid particles in the liquid phase environment, but in
                    the paper recycling process, the scale of ink and fine fibers is close to each other. So, it is
                    difficult to effectively separate by flotation method. <br>

                    However, most of the ink and fibers still have differences in the hydrophilic relationship, and
                    perhaps hydrophobic solvent extraction can be more effective in separating them. <br>

                    <b>Notion:</b><br>
                    The reason why we could not improve the separation efficiency before may be the floating method, not
                    just about fiber quality.<br>

                    <b>Decision:</b> <br>
                    With the help of Prof. Sha, We fully analyze the properties behind the industrial treatments to
                    better find the key and feasible solutions to the problem. Considering the environmental
                    friendliness and biodegradability, we use limonene for ink extraction, rather than the original
                    flotation method by surfactants, bettering the deinking process.<br>

                    We had an in-depth discussion with Prof. Xiao about the biosafety strategy of wrapping engineering
                    bacteria by using alginate hydrogel beads, especially the side effects of alginate hydrogel beads in

                    Dr. Xiao regrettably indicated that we could not narrow the pore size of the hydrogel to avoid the
                    dissipation of small molecules of nutrients and inducers, because it might also impact the
                    adsorption process of heavy metal ions. At the very least, using a hydrogel carrier is not the most

                    We once again communicated with the Nine Dragons Paper Company Limited. about the feasibility of our

                    We had cooperated with the Science and Technology Museum to organize a science popularization event
                    with the theme of protecting forests and saving paper. By issuing brochures, playing games, poster
                    displays, and project promotion, we helped children and teenagers understand the ways of wastepaper
                    recycling and cultivate a paper-saving lifestyle. <br>

                    <b>Notion:</b><br>
                    We have received many positive feedbacks from participants of our event. We really felt that many of
                    them are curious about nature and thirsty for knowledge. However, most of the participants were
                    under preliminary school age, so we then plan to carry out events among older children.<br>

                    <b>Decision:</b> <br>
                    Through this activity, XMU-China not only demonstrated scientific research achievements and
                    innovative thinking but also reflected the iGEMer's sense of social responsibility and public
                    welfare spirit.<br>

                    <b>Will:</b><br>
                    Based on previous research and activities, we decided to promote science popularization for children
                    and teenagers to raise their awareness of paper saving and forest conservation.<br>

                    We came to the Yanwu Primary School to carry out the Protect the Forest and Save Paper science
                    popularization activities, which not only included the popularization of knowledge but also included
                    tailored experiments. In the class, Prof. Hong, the PI of our team, introduced some basic knowledge
                    about forests to students and explained how trees simply become our writing paper.<br>

                    He also explained to the students the indispensable "partner" in synthetic biology ---- E. coli,
                    which excites the children's interest. Through picture display and video learning, the children had
                    a new understanding of E. coli, and the infinite possibilities given by synthetic biology also make
                    them felt the charm of science. <br>

                    To let the students better understand the nature of carbon dioxide and the concept of forest
                    protection, the team designed a variety of fun experiments in advance to help the children better
                    understand the scientific principles behind the interesting phenomenon through the way of education
                    and entertainment. <br>

                    <b>Notion:</b><br>
                    By enriching our learning methods and constantly trying in practice, we cannot be limited to
                    textbook knowledge and truly feel the charm of science in life. We also hope to stimulate students'
                    interest in synthetic biology through this activity, so that the flame of synthetic biology will
                    pass on.<br>

                    <b>Decision:</b> <br>
                    This activity not only enhanced the children's awareness of treasure and protection of forest
                    resources but also let the children develop a paper-saving lifestyle. So far, with many offline
                    activities, we decided to publish these gains in the form of popular science articles on our public
                    account so that more people can understand and even join our actions to protect forests and cope
                    with the climate crisis.<br>
