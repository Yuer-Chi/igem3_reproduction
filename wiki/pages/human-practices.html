                        The ongoing <b>climate crisis</b> driven by high levels of carbon dioxide emissions has led to
                        numerous
                        disasters and heavy losses worldwide. Climate-related disasters, such as the alarming melting of
                        glaciers, rising sea levels, and a surge in extreme weather events, have become increasingly
                        frequent and severe over the years. According to incomplete data statistics, these catastrophic
                        weather events resulted in significant economic losses and substantial human casualties,
                        reaching

                        After discussions with Assistant Professor <b>Liang Dan</b>, we recognized the vital role of
                        trees in global climate
                        regulation. Due to their long growth cycles, trees recover slowly after large-scale
                        deforestation, which worsens the climate crisis. <b>So, promoting the recycling of renewable
                            resources, especially paper, is the best way to protect forest resources and mitigate the
                            climate crisis</b>. After consulting the reference, we know that <b>129.65-million-ton</b>
                        paper products
                        were produced in <b>2023</b>, which accounts for <b>39.5%</b> of total timber consumption in
                        China (2), while the
                        utilization rate of waste paper has <b>decreased from 72.5% (2014)</b> to <b>52.4% (2023)</b>
                        (3).
                        After a field
                        survey of the paper enterprises, we learned that the inefficiency of deinking and pollution in
                        the paper recycling process continues to limit paper recycling efforts significantly. For waste
                        paper entering the recycling process, removing ink from the waste paper is the main intractable
                        problem, including <b>high cost</b>, <b>environmental pollution</b>, and <b>health risks</b>.
                        Thus, our project
                        focuses on developing a <b>green and sustainable method</b> to overcome this problem.

                        To make paper recycling more environmentally friendly and cost-effective, we plan to optimize
                        the industrial waste paper recycling process using synthetic biology techniques. We developed
                        and refined our project through interviews with experts from both academia and industry. After
                        consulting with Associate Professor <b>Yang Liulin</b> and <b>Ling Chen</b>, we selected an
                        efficient deinking enzyme to remove the ink from the
                        pulp. We
                        consulted with Ms. <b>Zhuang Xiaoyan</b>, and she pointed out that using an autolysis system in
                        industrial applications would require large amounts of expensive inducers, making it
                        cost-prohibitive. She recommended using <b>signal peptides</b> instead, which skip the expensive
                        protein purification and/or inducers. Based on our enterprise survey, we discovered that
                        deinking flotation is the preferred method for removing printed ink from paper during the
                        recycling process. However, this method will cause a loss of fibers, thus lowering the recovery
                        rate. To address this issue, we consulted Associate Professor <b>Sha Yong</b>, an expert in
                        petroleum
                        extraction. He advised us to use a hydrophobic solvent to extract the ink. Therefore,
                        we chose to use <b>limonene</b>, a hydrophobic solvent that can be biosynthesized, from many
                        hydrophobic solvents to extract the ink in the pulp after enzymatic deinking. These <b>human
                            practices have provided theoretical guidance for our project</b>, allowing us to enhance and
                        refine
                        our research continually.

                        We
                        conducted surveys to understand people's attitudes toward paper recycling and the use of
                        recycled paper. We organized a <b>communication seminar</b> to introduce synthetic biology

                        The climate crisis, a pressing issue of our time, is primarily driven by greenhouse gas
                        <b>(GHG)</b>, such
                        as carbon dioxide , trapping heat in the atmosphere. This results in global warming,

                        the alarming melting of glaciers, rising sea levels, and a surge in extreme weather events. The
                        El Niño phenomenon, which has become increasingly erratic and destructive, is a stark example of
                        these changes. It has caused severe flooding in countries like Peru and Ecuador in South
                        America, and devastating droughts in places like Australia, Indonesia, and parts of Southeast
                        Asia. These weather disasters have had profound impacts on agriculture, infrastructure, and
                        national economies. <b>The global climate crisis is rapidly worsening</b>, with countries facing
                        escalating crop failures, higher economic costs, and more frequent natural disasters.

                    <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
                        In response to this growing threat, governments worldwide have implemented various policies to
                        mitigate the effects of climate change. One key initiative is the Paris Agreement, which aims to
                        keep the increase in global average temperature well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels.
                        These efforts focus on two main strategies: <b>reducing the sources of greenhouse gas
                            <b>(GHG)</b> emissions
                            and
                            improving carbon absorption</b>. Reducing emissions focuses on energy conservation and
                        cutting
                        emissions, like using energy more efficiently and switching to renewable sources such as solar
                        and wind power. Improving carbon absorption relies mostly on natural solutions. <b>The best way

                        reforestation projects and promoting sustainable land use to strengthen the Earth's natural
                        ability to absorb emissions. However, the growth rate of wood is far from enough to meet the

                        After searching for information from the literature, we found that forests are vital in

                    <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
                        It is known that paper production and consumption require the felling of many trees. In 2023,
                        China produced <b>129.65 million tons</b> of paper and paperboard, equivalent to cutting down
                        over <b>20
                            billion trees</b> (2). To better understand the impact of paper production on the climate
                        and
                        environment, we held discussions with the Zhangzhou Municipal Ecology and Environment Bureau.
                        The Bureau staff noted that the paper industry not only accelerates the depletion of forest
                        resources but also contributes significantly to carbon emissions and environmental pollution,
                        such as black liquor waste and wastewater containing high levels of ammonia, nitrogen, and total
                        phosphorus. Many paper enterprises have been classified as "pollutant discharging entities."
                        This made us realize that the paper industry urgently needs to <b>adopt a more sustainable

                        forests has never been more critical. Deforestation, driven by commercial purposes such as paper
                        production, exacerbates this issue by the destruction of vital carbon sinks. Thus, Paper
                        recycling is an effective way to protect the forests and mitigate the climate crisis. However,

                        considered using several enzymes as potential deinking agents, such as cellulase and laccase, to
                        break down the ink binder and remove the ink. So, we consulted Associate Professor Yang Liulin,

                        down the polymer resin in the ink binder efficiently. He further advised us to use cellulase to

                        effective variants.

                        In our initial design, we considered using an autolysis system to release enzymes. To evaluate
                        the feasibility of this approach, we consulted with Ms. Zhuang Xiaoyan. She pointed out that
                        using an autolysis system in industrial applications would require large amounts of expensive
                        inducers, making it cost-prohibitive. She recommended <b>using signal peptides instead</b>,
                        which
                        offers three key advantages. <b>Firstly</b>, it can secrete the target protein extracellularly
                        and
                        avoid the expensive protein purification procedure, significantly reducing production costs.
                        <b>Secondly</b>, engineered bacteria can continuously release enzymes rather than undergoing
                        one-time
                        lysis, thus improving efficiency. <b>Lastly</b>, unlike the autolysis system, which poses a
                        biosecurity
                        risk by potentially releasing plasmids, signal peptides help minimize this risk. Based on her
                        advice, we tested various signal peptides and selected the most effective one.

                        Based on our survey, we discovered that deinking flotation is the preferred method for removing
                        printed ink from paper during the recycling process. The process is based on the difference
                        between hydrophilic and hydrophobic inks, in which the latter can be removed from the pulp
                        suspension by adhering to bubbles (6). However, this method will cause a loss of fibers, thus
                        lowering the recovery rate. This problem was also verified by the senior staff in the paper
                        enterprise. To address this issue, we consulted Associate Professor Sha Yong, an expert in
                        petroleum extraction. He explained, "Because the scale of ink and pulp fibers is close to each
                        other,
                        flotation methods are difficult to separate them effectively. <b>Using a hydrophobic solvent to
                            extract the ink might be possible</b>." Therefore, we chose to use limonene from
                        many
                        hydrophobic solvents to extract the ink in the pulp after enzymatic deinking. It can be
                        synthesized through synthetic biology and fermentation engineering (7), <b>overcoming the
                            shortage
                            of flotation method that carries away a large number of pulp fibers so as to minimize the
                            loss
                            of fibers</b>. Upon testing, we observed a significant improvement in the deinking process.

                        In previous conversations with staff at Nine Dragons Paper Limited, we learned that
                        sterilization processes commonly used in enterprises include UV and filtration. However, these
                        processes do not fully meet biosafety standards, posing a potential risk of engineered bacteria
                        escaping into the environment, which could threaten ecological health and biodiversity. We
                        designed a light-triggered kill switch to avoid introducing additional chemicals into
                        wastewater, such as various inducers. After deinking in a dark circumstance, the inbuilt kill
                        switch will be turned to the “ON” state via exposure to a specific wavelength's light
                        illumination to achieve the biocontainment goal. To evaluate the feasibility of the new solution
                        in the industry, we revisited Nine Dragons Paper Limited at the end of the season.
                        After introducing the method in detail to the relevant staff, the staff acknowledged its
                        potential in terms of safety and flexibility. However, there were still concerns: “We need to
                        ensure the reliability and stability of this solution in practical applications. Additionally,
                        we must evaluate its impact on existing equipment and processes. If these issues can be
                        addressed, we believe this proposal is worth pursuing further.”

                        Following Assistant Professor Liang Dan's suggestion, we used the life cycle assessment (LCA)
                        method to calculate and compare the carbon emissions of enzymatic deinking and chemical deinking
                        methods in recycled paper production. We want to evaluate the contribution of our project to
                        the emission reduction of wastepaper recycling industry processes. The results indicate that the
                        use of enzymatic methods can reduce carbon emissions by XXX% and lower the production cost of
                        recycled paper by XXX%. Currently, we are in close collaboration with Professor Liang, and we
                        value his input in discussing the LCA and the contribution of our project to global
                        environmental sustainability.

                        Throughout this process, we explored the root causes of the climate crisis, highlighting the
                        critical importance of resource recycling and paper recovery. By collecting data and visiting
                        enterprises, we gained important insights into industrial-scale paper recycling challenges,

                        also deepened our understanding of the complexity of these issues. To promote our findings
                        further, we actively engaged in public education, reaching out to employees, students, and other
                        groups to spread awareness about synthetic biology and resource recycling. We hope to raise
