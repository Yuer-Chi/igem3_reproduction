          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            Secretion of recombinant protein from engineered bacteria ties to two components: 
            one is the <b>secretion machinery</b> of engineered bacteria, 
            and the other is the <b>signal peptide</b> or signal sequence. 
            The sequence of recombinant protein is obtained by fusing the sequence of protein of interest (POI) with the signal peptide, 
            in most cases, at the N-terminal of POI. 
            The type of signal peptide is accordance with the specific secretion pathway. 
            In prokaryotic cells, for many application systems, 
            there are two common secretion mechanisms of recombinant proteins: 
            Type I secretion system (T1SS) and Type I secretion system (T2SS). 
            More specially, T2SS contains more sub-type mechanisms, 
            including the Sec (or SecB) pathway, 
            SRP (signal recognition particle) pathway, 
            and Tat (twin-arginine translocation) pathway. 
          </p>



          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            To characterize the secretion efficiency of different signal peptides, 
            the <b>pulse-chase analysis</b> is performed to track the protein secretion of the engineered bacteria under the treatment of the protein synthesis inhibitor with the Western blot. 
            Then a nonlinear fitting with a <b>logarithmic equation</b> is employed to extract the extracellular secretion rate constant. 
            This protocol requires high-frequency sampling and complex operations, 
            easily leading to bias in evaluation. 
            Moreover, the experimental condition of pulse-chase analysis is quite different from real-work applications, 
            since the industrial processes do not stop the cell growth. 
            Thus, the extracellular secretion rate constant gained from the pulse-chase experiments 
            <b>contributes less in guiding the related synthetic biosystem design</b>.
          </p>


          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            This year, XMU-China tested the performance of multiple signal peptides in the continued growth state of cells, 
            resulting in distinct secretion kinetics compared to traditional logarithmic-shaped curves gained in pulse-chase experiments, 
            the <b>exponential-shaped curve</b> indeed (Figure 1A). 
            Some iGEM teams (Stuttgart 2017, IIT_Kanpur 2018) endeavor to build the kinetic landscape for the secretion in continued growth situations with the empirical formula, 
            showing less understanding of the biological insight for the complexity of translocation. 
            Not to mention that those teams failed in the reconstruction of logarithmic secretion kinetics. 
            Now, it is time to develop a new mathematical model to <b>describe and analyze the secretion kinetics under the practical way in real-world engineering</b>.
          </p>

            The original intention of this model was to <b>mathematically describe the relationship between the amount of secreted recombinant protein and time in the natural state of our engineered bacteria</b> 
            and explore the secretion efficiency of different signal peptides that we used, 
            thus choosing the best combination of signal peptide and Anderson promoter to <b>optimize the economic cost of our deinking process</b>. 
            Such a modeling process was of great significance for us in implementing REPARO and part collection.

            The cell is growing continually, 
            several sources contribute to the fluorescence measured from the supernatant (Figure 2), 
            including translocation system-driven protein secretion, 
            periplasmic space leakiness from cell division, 
            and release due to the lysis of dead cells, 
            which call for a detailed model for the quantity of viable, dead, and lysed cells 
            thus the model can distinguish the real signal peptide-driven secretion part for extracellular secretion rate constant estimation 
            and investigate the interactive effect between signal peptide and growth cell. 
            The macro-level model in the fermentation aspect is employed for the description of three different cell types 
            while the micro-level models from the molecular biology level model three sources that contribute to the fluorescence in the supernatant. 
            It is worth mentioning that 
            the key point to connect the macro-level model and the micro-level model is 
            the consideration of physical quantity of volume changes due to the transition between different spaces during secretion, 
            which is quite different from the model of pulse-chase analysis (XMU-China 2021).

            In daily life, people's needs for handwriting erasure are extensive and diverse. However, our current design
            is mainly focused on the deinking of pulp in the printing plant, so we hope to develop a product that can
            easily remove handwriting in daily life according to the deinking principle referred before.
          </p>
          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            The ink used in daily handwriting is mainly composed of <b>hydrophobic pigments</b> and <b>binders</b>, so
            using a better
            hydrophobic solvent may be possible to achieve the removal of handwriting. Our pre-experiments showed that
            the
            microemulsion consisting of surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and limonene had a good effect on
            dissolving ink and removed the handwriting to a certain extent. Considering environmental protection, we
            hope
            to choose rhamnolipid, a kind of surfactant that can be biosynthesized and easily degraded (15), accompanied
            with limonene to form microemulsion to achieve handwriting removal (Figure 7).
          </p>

            Additionally, for improving the recycling ability of the microemulsion, we intend to utilize adsorbents to
            adsorb the ink that is dissolved in the microemulsion after being removed from the paper. The adsorption
            materials containing chitosan as the main component can adsorb ink molecules through both physical and
            chemical effects while have the advantages of low toxicity, excellent biocompatibility and low cost over the
            traditional polymer hydrogel (29). Therefore, this kind of materials is chosen as the adsorbent conferring
            the
            reusability for the microemulsion, thus assisting the removal of daily handwriting.
