          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            Secretion of recombinant protein from engineered bacteria ties to two components: 
            one is the <b>secretion machinery</b> of engineered bacteria, 
            and the other is the <b>signal peptide</b> or signal sequence. 
            The sequence of recombinant protein is obtained by fusing the sequence of protein of interest (POI) with the signal peptide, 
            in most cases, at the N-terminal of POI. 
            The type of signal peptide is accordance with the specific secretion pathway. 
            In prokaryotic cells, for many application systems, 
            there are two common secretion mechanisms of recombinant proteins: 
            Type I secretion system (T1SS) and Type II secretion system (T2SS). 
            More specially, T2SS contains more sub-type mechanisms, 
            including the Sec (or SecB) pathway, 
            SRP (signal recognition particle) pathway, 
            and Tat (twin-arginine translocation) pathway. 
          </p>



          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            To characterize the secretion efficiency of different signal peptides, 
            the <b>pulse-chase analysis</b> is performed to track the protein secretion of the engineered bacteria under the treatment of the protein synthesis inhibitor with the Western blot. 
            Then a nonlinear fitting with a <b>logarithmic equation</b> is employed to extract the extracellular secretion rate constant. 
            This protocol requires high-frequency sampling and complex operations, 
            easily leading to bias in evaluation. 
            Moreover, the experimental condition of pulse-chase analysis is quite different from real-work applications, 
            since the industrial processes do not stop the cell growth. 
            Thus, the extracellular secretion rate constant gained from the pulse-chase experiments 
            <b>contributes less in guiding the related synthetic biosystem design</b>.
          </p>


          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            This year, XMU-China tested the performance of multiple signal peptides in the continued growth state of cells, 
            resulting in distinct secretion kinetics compared to traditional logarithmic-shaped curves gained in pulse-chase experiments, 
            the <b>exponential-shaped curve</b> indeed (Figure 1A). 
            Some iGEM teams (Stuttgart 2017, IIT_Kanpur 2018) endeavor to build the kinetic landscape for the secretion in continued growth situations with the empirical formula, 
            showing less understanding of the biological insight for the complexity of translocation. 
            Not to mention that those teams failed in the reconstruction of logarithmic secretion kinetics. 
            Now, it is time to develop a new mathematical model to <b>describe and analyze the secretion kinetics under the practical way in real-world engineering</b>.

            The original intention of this model was to <b>mathematically describe the relationship between the amount of secreted recombinant protein and time in the natural state of our engineered bacteria</b> 
            and explore the secretion efficiency of different signal peptides that we used, 
            thus choosing the best combination of signal peptide and Anderson promoter to <b>optimize the economic cost of our deinking process</b>. 
            Such a modeling process was of great significance for us in implementing REPARO and part collection.

            The cell is growing continually, 
            several sources contribute to the fluorescence measured from the supernatant (Figure 2), 
            including translocation system-driven protein secretion, 
            periplasmic space leakiness from cell division, 
            and release due to the lysis of dead cells, 
            which call for a detailed model for the quantity of viable, dead, and lysed cells 
            thus the model can distinguish the real signal peptide-driven secretion part for extracellular secretion rate constant estimation 
            and investigate the interactive effect between signal peptide and growth cell. 
            The macro-level model in the fermentation aspect is employed for the description of three different cell types 
            while the micro-level models from the molecular biology level model three sources that contribute to the fluorescence in the supernatant. 
            It is worth mentioning that the key point to connect the macro-level model and the micro-level model is 
            the consideration of the physical quantity of volume changes due to the transition between different spaces during secretion, 
            as well as the transition between concentration and density, 
            which is quite different from the model of pulse-chase analysis (XMU-China, 2021).

            <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">

              For Sec pathway (left in Fig. 3), 
              a soluble molecular chaperone protein named SecB binds to the recombinant protein's signal peptide or other features of its incompletely folded structure. 
              The bound protein is then delivered to SecA, a protein acts as both a receptor and a translocating ATPase that is associated with the cytoplasm membrane. 
              The Sec-recombinant protein complex forms a translocation complex with SecY/SecE/SecG (SecYEG). 
              The protein is conducted by the energy released from ATP hydrolysis and PMF (proton motive force). 
              The SecDF complex (YajC is an accessory protein) plays the role as the signal peptidase (SPase) to cleave the signal peptide in the final stage of translocation. 
              Then the protein maturation will happen in the periplasm space finally. 
              Thus, the micro-level model for Sec pathway-related signal peptide will be written based on mass action law and macro-level model as follows:

            The Tat pathway is commonly used for those proteins that contain two consecutive and highly conserved arginine residues in their leader peptides. 
            On the Tat pathway (right in Fig. 3), 
            the protein is fully synthesized and folds in the cytoplasm where it can bind specific cofactors. 
            The signal peptide is then recognized by TatC in the TatBC complex. 
            Signal peptide binding promotes association of the complex with TatA oligomers at the expense of PMF. 
            Protein translocation occurs through a channel formed by TatA and possibly TatE oligomers. 
            Thus, the micro-level model for Tat pathway-related signal peptide will be written based on mass action law and macro-level model as follows:

  Once the minimization goals are confirmed, the fluorescence data and biomass data can be collected using standard protocols. 

</p>




<p class="myPage-paragraph-content">



When performing the parameters fitting task with programming, 
only the data collected in logarithmic phase was used to ensure the stable metabolic state and parameters. 
The measured fluorescence data was normalized to the interval from 0 to 2, which will be helpful for weight balancing between different terms in minimization goals for both micro-level model and macro-level model. 
The two secretion kinetic parameters, $\alpha$ and $\gamma$, are first-order terms in the ODE, which can be recovered by rescale operation after fitting to eliminate the effect of normalization. 
Besides, a two-stage fitting schedule was employed to get the accurate parameters: 
(1) the genetic algorithm is used to search the near-optimal values for unknown parameters first; 
(2) the result of the genetic algorithm works as the initial guess for trust region constrained algorithms to optimize a better fitting.

<h3 class="myPage-paragraph-headline-h3">Highest Secretion Efficiency and Proper Metabolic Burden of LMT Signal Peptide</h3>



<p class="myPage-paragraph-content">


The secretion kinetics of various signal peptides from both the Sec pathway (LMT, PelB, OmpA, OsmY, YebF, and AIgen) and the Tat pathway (TorA) were analyzed (Figure 4). 
The high average R<sup>2</sup> values for each signal peptide (<u>LMT: 0.994, PelB: 0.993, OmpA: 0.987, OsmY: 0.933, YebF: 0.989, TorA: 0.975, AIgen: 0.988</u>) 
confirm the accuracy of the multi-scale model in capturing secretion kinetics and demonstrate the successful application of the MUSES method. 
The experimental results aligned well with the model's predictions (Figure 4A-G), 
indicating that the multi-scale estimation method effectively deconstructs the dynamic secretion process of signal peptides, 
avoiding the need for pulse-chase experiments. 
In the subsequent discussion, emphasis was placed on the Sec pathway, since the TorA (Tat pathway) show quite low secretion efficiency here (Figure 1B).

<p class="myPage-paragraph-content">

The percentages of secretion, leakiness, and lysis, 
which are three primary contributors to supernatant fluorescence, changed dynamically with cell growth (Figure 5A-G). 
Initially, the secretion part contributed the most to the supernatant fluorescence, 
but as the culture medium's environment deteriorated due to metabolic waste, the lysis part increased, and the secretion one decreased. 
Leakiness plateaued quickly because the data used for estimation were collected during the logarithmic growth phase, 
and leakiness is the only factor related to cell growth. 
This dynamic resulted in varying proportions of supernatant fluorescence among different signal peptides by the end of the experiment (Figure 5H). 
However, AIgen and OmpA groups did not follow this trend due to the combination of a high $\alpha$ value (translocation rate from the cytoplasm to the periplasm) 
and a relatively low $\gamma$ value (secretion efficiency). Both groups had high OD<sub>600</sub>, 
and leakiness and lysis contributed the most to their fluorescence. 
The OmpA group, with a higher $\alpha$ value than the AIgen group (Figure 4H), 
had more immature proteins translocating to the periplasm and maturing, 
resulting in higher supernatant fluorescence compared to AIgen group.

<p class="myPage-paragraph-content">

Among the Sec pathway signal peptides, 
The PelB group's lysis part contributed about 50% of its supernatant fluorescence (Figure 5H), 
which was attributed to cell death caused by high metabolic burden (Figure 1C, lowest OD<sub>600</sub>). 
This also influenced the normalized fluorescence intensity of the culture, 
leading to lower supernatant fluorescence (Figure 1C). 
The OsmY group's low supernatant fluorescence was due to similar reasons (Figure 1C), 
with its lowest $\alpha$ value making it the group with the lowest supernatant fluorescence (Figure 4H). 
YebF experienced metabolic stress too, resulting in lower normalized fluorescence intensity and OD<sub>600</sub>, 
but its higher $\alpha$ value, nearly 1.5 times that of OsmY group (Figure 4H), 
contributed to slightly higher supernatant fluorescence (Figure 1C). 
<b>LMT</b>, a newly discovered signal peptide by Team XMU-China 2021 with excellent intrinsic secretion kinetic parameters, 
had <b>a $\gamma$ value that is 6.55-45.44 times higher</b> than the others in Sec pathway (Figure 4H), 
indicating <b>the highest secretion efficiency</b>. 
With a <b>considerable $\alpha$ value</b> (Figure 4H) and <b>proper metabolic burden</b>, LMT achieved the <b>highest supernatant fluorescence</b> (Figure 1C).

<p class="myPage-paragraph-content">

  Thus LMT, the best signal peptide among all test groups, 
  whose high secretion efficiency and low metabolic burden are confirmed with our multi-scale model, 
  was chosen to test coupling with our deinking enzymes (the best one in the second screen cycle, CYP199A4 T253E). 
  The SDS-PAGE proves the successful secretion of CYP199A4 T253E (Figure 6A), 
  and the deinking characterization result achieved 64% performance of the high-concentration enzyme sampling prepared by ÄKTA/AKTA (Figure 6B),

  <h3 class="myPage-paragraph-headline-h3">LMT-mediated Secretion under Constitutive Expression for Optimal Economic Cost</h3>





<p class="myPage-paragraph-content">

  Previous LMT-mediated secretion work in our project is based on T7 promoter, 
  requiring the addition of IPTG to induce the expression of the fusion protein of our deinking enzyme and LMT signal peptide. 
  The IPTG has a toxic effect on cells, which is also expensive in industrial-scale applications. 
  Thus, <b>designing the LMT-mediated secretion system under constitutive expression is essential for the implementation of REPARO by eliminating the extra cost (inducer for example) to achieve optimal economic cost</b>.
  
</p>

<p class="myPage-paragraph-content">

  The multi-scale model reveals that the proper combination of metabolic stress and secretion efficiency 
  contributes to the final secretion performance in the natural growth state of engineered bacteria, both of which are indispensable. 
  When the secretion system is controlled by the constitutive promoter, 
  <b>this principle will be more crucial since the metabolic stress induced by the signal peptides exists from beginning to end.</b> 
  Austin_UTexas 2019 measured all the metabolic burden and expression strength of the Anderson promoters, 
  where we try to select several representative one to investigate and verify our multi-scale model, 
  guiding the design of LMT-mediated secretion system compiling under constitutive expression.

<p class="myPage-paragraph-content">

  A Gaussian mixture model was employed to cluster all the data pair of metabolic burden and expression stress for Anderson promoters to four main classes (Figure 7): 
  <b>(1) Class 1</b>: high expression strength with high metabolic burden; 
  <b>(2) Class 2</b>: medium expression strength with high metabolic burden; 
  <b>(3) Class 3</b>: medium expression strength with medium metabolic burden; 
  <b>(4) Class 4</b>: low expression strength with low metabolic burden.

  <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">

    Coupling with signal peptides, the multi-scale model predicites the phenomenoa about secretion kinetic in those four regions qualitatively: 
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>(1) Class 1</b>: High metabolic burden-induced cell death result in high secretion effiency and low total protein synthesis; 
    <br>
    <b>(2) Class 2</b>: Transition area ; 
    <br>
    <b>(3) Class 3</b>: Medium metabolic burden result in high total protein synthesis, thus the secretion efficiency of the signal peptides is the main barrier here; 
    <br>
    <b>(4) Class 4</b>: Low metabolic burden results in low total protein synthesis, thus the signal peptides can translocate all the proteins and high secretion efficiency is achieved.

            In daily life, people's needs for handwriting erasure are extensive and diverse. However, our current design

            The ink used in daily handwriting is mainly composed of <b>hydrophobic pigments</b> and <b>binders</b>, so
            using a better
            hydrophobic solvent may be possible to achieve the removal of handwriting. Our pre-experiments showed that
            the
            microemulsion consisting of surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and limonene had a good effect on
            dissolving ink and removed the handwriting to a certain extent. Considering environmental protection, we
            hope
            to choose rhamnolipid, a kind of surfactant that can be biosynthesized and easily degraded (15), accompanied
            with limonene to form microemulsion to achieve handwriting removal (Figure 7).

            Additionally, for improving the recycling ability of the microemulsion, we intend to utilize adsorbents to
            adsorb the ink that is dissolved in the microemulsion after being removed from the paper. The adsorption
            materials containing chitosan as the main component can adsorb ink molecules through both physical and
            chemical effects while have the advantages of low toxicity, excellent biocompatibility and low cost over the
            traditional polymer hydrogel (29). Therefore, this kind of materials is chosen as the adsorbent conferring
            the
            reusability for the microemulsion, thus assisting the removal of daily handwriting.
