                with the deadline for

                of students who were aspiring and expecting to be selected into iGEM, namely us, were studying hard. We
                were so busy during this wonderful time that we even declined an invitation from our classmates to go to
                the playground to watch a meteor shower, what a pity! But fortunately, finally, after successfully
                completing it, we managed to get together with everyone in the middle of the night and spent a few hours
                having fun with them. But it also means that we're also coming up to the final week of the semester, and
                time is tight!

                At this day, we had an exchange and learning session with HUBU-China. We not only introduced our
                respective projects but also shared the experiences accumulated by our teams. This was the first time
                during this season that we have exchanged ideas with another participating team. Therefore, our team
                took it very seriously, with everyone participating, making for a grand scene. Happily, the overall
                communication went smoothly.

                extract it with limonene. To our surprise, the effect is very good, and finally we are not a heartbroken
                persons!

                for this season. She hope there aren't too many more late nights ahead, haha, because health is really

                our research topics and experiments, enjoying a pleasant time together. After dinner, members of our two
                groups (the Printing Group and the Life Group) engaged in a heated discussion. It really was a thorough
                and intense brainstorming session. In the end, we exchanged well wishes and cheered each other on with a
                hearty "Go, go, go! Let's ace those experiments". Onward and upward!

                OD600. However, after three days of hard work, we found that this method is not feasible.

                - We participated in an education activity at the Xiamen Science and Technology Museum, promoting waste
                paper recycling and environmental awareness. Some of us organized a quiz game for children on recycling
                and forest protection, while others took photos, distributed surveys, and gave presentations. Through
                teamwork, we raised public awareness and deepened my understanding of the importance of environmental
                education.

                experiments were not very smooth, in some conversion experiments, no bacteria grew on the board; In
                other conversion experiments, a few bacteria grew out of the board, but the bacteria were picked from
                the board, the plasmid was extracted and sent for testing, and the sequencing results also told me that
                the gene of the protein had been mutated, and gfpfasta could not glow. After more than a week of hard
                transformation, the experiment finally succeeded, the luminous bacteria grew on the two boards, and the
                colony pcr also got the correct band.

                - The weather is rainy and Yi Zhang not in the mood at all. However, after the group meeting today, we
                all got together to chat, which made me feel extraordinarily relaxed. Next, she is going to continue
                working on drawings and look forward to finishing the webpage as quickly as possible these days.

                - At last! The saturation mutation of CYP199A4 is complete, and the next step is to try to combine the
                secretion system with the deinking enzyme. Can we really accomplish this?

                Whoa, whoa, whoa! LMT-253E circuit has built! We can finally try the effect of deinking enzyme in

                be possible to build it before wiki freeze.

                - Today, we visited Yanwu Elementary School in Xiamen and had a wonderful time interacting with the
                kids. We taught them about the importance of protecting forests and saving paper, and they were
                incredibly enthusiastic and eager to learn. We even conducted some fun experiments together, and the
                kids were so cooperative and engaged. It was a delightful experience, and their excitement was truly
                contagious. We left feeling inspired and hopeful for the future, knowing that these young minds are so
                receptive to environmental conservation!

                - That's great! Although 253E is not the best deinking enzyme, but the LMT-253E still plays a good
                deinking effect, let us work harder, LMT-253A performance will be better, let's show it's deinking
                effect on the presentation video.
