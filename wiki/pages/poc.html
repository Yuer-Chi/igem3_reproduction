              this,

            0.6 g NaOH, 0.6 g Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>, and 1.0 mL H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were added to 30 mL
            pulp with 1% concentration, and the final
            concentration of monooxygenase CYP199A4 T253A was 1 μM. After the reaction at 30°C for 60 min, limonene was
            added to the pulp for ink extraction, finally draining by using a Buchner funnel. The recycled paper is
            imaged after draining, and the gray scale value is read by a written program. The higher the gray scale
            value, the better the deinking effect is proved, which means the whiter the paper is observed, the less ink
            remains (see the SOP for details). Based on the screen and analysis, we found that the 253 residue was the
            targeted position that contributed to the deinking. So, saturation mutation on the 253 position was carried
            out to harvest the best mutant. As shown in Figure 1, the gray scale value of some mutants increased by 50%
            at least, in which 253A shows the best performance in deinking. As shown in the picture from the microscope
            (Figure 2), the paper treated with CYP199A4 T253A (Figure 2A) has minimal ink residue among these enzymes.
            The paper is relatively white, and the observed lifting effect has reached 100% of the Negative (Figure 2

            We have successfully established a screening method for enzymes with high deinking efficiency based on the
            gray scale value changes. Leveraging the monooxygenase CYP199A4 and its mutants reported in the literature,
            we have identified a monooxygenase with high efficiency in deinking, a significant milestone in the
            wastepaper recycling process (see <a style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: none;"
              href="{{ url_for('pages', page='design') }}">Design</a> for more details). This, combined with a rapid
            screening method,
            structure-activity analysis, and saturation mutation, has led us to the <b>CYP199A4 mutant T253A</b> (see <a

              href="{{ url_for('pages', page='part-collection') }}">Part Collection</a> for more details), which
            exhibits superior deinking performance. In our proposed implementation,
            these enzymes will be introduced into the industrial pulping environment, and further characterization will
            focus on the efficiency and stability of the enzyme release system.

          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            In practical applications, the high-performance deinking enzymes we have identified must be directly applied
            to large-scale pulp deinking reactors. However, both protein purification and the inducers-dependent <i>E.
              coli</i>
            autolytic system FLSA (FhuD-T7 lysozyme-SsrA mediated autolytic system, see <a
              style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: none;" href="{{ url_for('pages', page='design') }}">Design</a>
            for more details) can be
            costly. In addition, the FLSA system can also lead to the production of a large number of miscellaneous
            proteins, which can affect the deinking effect of the target enzyme. To address these challenges and ensure
            the practicality of our research, we have decided to use a cost-effective approach. We will use the signal
            peptide to directly secret the enzyme outside the cell (see <a
              style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: none;" href="{{ url_for('pages', page='design') }}">Design</a>
            for more details), thereby bypassing the
            protein purification step and avoiding the use of inducers. Combined with constitutive promoters, this
            approach will significantly reduce the operation steps and costs, making our method more practical for
            industrial application. In this section, we aim to characterize the effectiveness of releasing target
            proteins and select the most efficient and stable signal peptide.

          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            Eight classic signal peptides, such as LMT, PelB, OmpA, OsmY, YebF, AIgen, TorA, and HlyA, were used to
            construct the signal peptide-sfGFP fusion protein. The contribution values of secretion, leakage, and
            cleavage
            processes to the fluorescence of supernatants were used to characterize the secretion efficiency of signal
            peptides, exploring their secretion dynamics. As shown in Figure 3, at a low cell lysis rate, sfGFP secreted
            by the LMT makes a more significant contribution to the supernatant fluorescence, proving that <b>the LMT

            We have proved that some CYP199A4 mutants showed stronger deinking, and LMT showed a good secretion effect.
            So, we try to verify the deinking efficiency of CYP199A4 mutants secreted to the supernatant by the LMT. The
            engineered bacteria were cultured at 25°C, and the supernatant culture was taken at 12 h, 18 h, 24 h, and 36
            h, respectively, using SDS-PAGE to demonstrate that the fusion protein could be successfully secreted into
            the supernatant. Gray scale value analysis was performed on the bands, proving that the concentration of
            LMT-CYP199A4 T253E in the culture supernatant gradually increased with time (Figure 4A). At the same time,
            the supernatant from the culture in 36 hours was used for the pulp deinking experiment (see <a

            more

            T253E in the supernatant showed a perfect deinking effect, with an increase effect of 71.7%. <b>The above
              results showed that LMT signal peptide could secrete CYP199A4 T253E to the extracellular environment

            <b>Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)</b> is a comprehensive method used to evaluate the environmental influence of
            a

            assessment of the contribution of our projects to the emission reduction of wastepaper recycling industry
            processes. In this part, we will combine experimental data and related studies to quantify energy
            consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste generation. By calculating and comparing the carbon
            emissions of the enzymatic method and chemical method in recycled paper production, we comprehensively
            evaluate the contribution of our project to emission reduction.

          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            We calculated the input/output process of recycled paper production without considering the difference in
            carbon emissions caused by the pretreatment process. We considered the carbon emissions from the production
            of chemical reagents in the deinking process, the respiratory volume of enzyme-producing bacteria, and the
            corresponding electricity consumption. <b>The results showed that the carbon emissions were reduced by the
              enzymatic deinking method by 30.7% compared with the chemical deinking method</b>. The waste treatment
            process
            considers the chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids (SS), and
            other harmful substances in the wastewater. Compared with the chemical method, the carbon emission of the
            wastewater treated by the enzymatic method is reduced by 50%. The overall emission reduction optimization
            degree of the final scheme is 21.1% (Figure 5), which highlights that the enzymatic method has more
            advantages in reducing carbon emissions than the classical chemical method, and it can be a more sustainable
