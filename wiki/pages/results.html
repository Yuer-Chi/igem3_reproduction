          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            Deinking is the bottleneck for waste paper recycling, which requires a substantial amount of toxic
            chemicals. It also releases poisonous organic agents and heavy metals that may cause environmental
            contamination and expensive disposal costs.
            Our project, REPARO, focuses on developing an unprecedented solution based on synthetic biology, which could
            serve as a viable alternative to the chemical method on the industry scale. We have successfully established
            a screening method for enzymes with high deinking efficiency based on the grayscale value changes.
            Leveraging the monooxygenase CYP199A4 and its mutants reported in the literature, we have identified a
            monooxygenase with high efficiency in deinking, a significant milestone in the wastepaper recycling process.
            This, combined with a rapid screening method, structure-activity analysis, and saturation mutation, has led
            us to the CYP199A4 mutant T253A, which exhibits superior deinking performance. By characterizing classic
            signal peptides, we proved that LMT has a high secretion efficiency. It realized the continuous secretion of
            CYP199A4 T253E with significant deinking performance. Furthermore, we expanded the application in erasing
            the handwriting based on the combination of crosslinked chitosan and rhamnolipid. Beyond that, displaying
            the metallothioneins on the surface of engineered bacteria could successfully reduce the heavy metal ion
            Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>2-</sup> in the wastewater. Finally, we proved that the scheme we designed
            is reasonable and feasible, which
            paves the way for its application at an industrial scale.

          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            The deinking blank system consisted of a 50 mL pulp with 1 g Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>, and 1.67 mL
            H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Ref.), which is same
            in each deinking method. Pulp was produced by the paper that printed the same article, ensuring the same ink
            concentration. The pulp preparation referred to standard operating procedure (see <a
              style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: none;" href="{{ url_for('pages', page='sop') }}">SOP</a> for
            more details).
            Then, limonene (see <a style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: none;"

            hydrophobic solvents to extract
            the ink from the mixture after the reaction. The suction filtration was carried out through the Buchner
            funnel to remove the water and dry it in ovens. Take a picture for the paper cake after drying, and read the
            gray value through the written program by automatically selecting (see <a
              style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: none;" href="{{ url_for('pages', page='sop') }}">SOP</a> for

            processes were summarized to a standard operating procedure (see <a
              style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: none;" href="{{ url_for('pages', page='sop') }}">SOP</a> for
            more details). It was worth noting
            that the higher the gray value, the better the deinking effect. The experimental results showed that the

            procedure (see <a style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: none;"
              href="{{ url_for('pages', page='sop') }}">SOP</a> for more details), read the gray scale value
            automatically. The experimental results
            showed that there was no obvious improvement in the gray scale value in the two multienzymes compared with
            that of a single enzyme. We found that gray scale value of waste paper treated by monooxygenase was the
            highest one among the enzymes. Therefore, we hope to conduct further research on monooxygenase to optimize
            the deinking effect of waste paper enzymes.

            NADPH is an expensive coenzyme (428.7 $/g), which propels us to give up the way to use the NADPH-dependent
            P450 in the waste paper deinking. After reviewing the literature, we chose three kinds of monooxygenases,
            CYP199A4, OleT<sub>JE</sub> and SfmD and their mutants, which use H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as an electron
            donor. The targeted sequence was
            inserted in pET-28a(+) to construct circuits, which were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) to express each
            enzyme. The positive transformants were confirmed by kanamycin, colony PCR, and sequencing. After being
            cultivated and induced by 0.5 mM IPTG at 20 °C, the induction of CYP199A4 requires the addition of
            δ-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride (0.5 mM), the GE AKTA Prime Plus FPLC System was employed to get
            purified protein from the lysate supernatant. SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining were used to verify the
            expression of the target protein.

            Based on the results from the preliminary experiment, many enzymes exhibit excellent deinking performance,
            resulting in the saturation of the grayscale value. Thus, each enzyme was diluted from 0.2 mg/mL to 0.05
            mg/mL. 1 mL of each monooxygenase (0.05 mg/mL) was added to the deinking blank system and reacted at 30 °C
            (the average of the two optimal temperatures) for 60 min. After the standard operating procedure (see <a

            for more details), read the gray scale value automatically. As shown in Figure 17, the gray scale value of
            some mutants increased by 50% at least, in which 253A shows the best performance in deinking. As shown in
            the picture from the microscope (Figure 18), the paper treated with CYP199A4 T253A (Figure 18) has minimal
            ink residue among these enzymes. The paper is relatively white, and the observed effect has reached 1.06
            times higher than chemical deinking (Figure 18 chemical method).

          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            Protein purification was a tedious procedure that also cost a lot of money. We attempted to construct
            engineered bacteria based on synthetic biology to address the release of target proteins, which could skip
            the protein purification step. Therefore, we obtained a modified LLSA system (please see Design and
            Engineering Success for details) from the E. coli autolytic system FLSA (FhuD-T7 lysozyme-SsrA mediated
            autolytic system) (1). The system is designed to ensure that the target proteins can be efficiently produced
            and smoothly released outside the cell, thus simplifying the process of obtaining the target proteins and
            decreasing the treatment process cost (FLSA) (1). For the functional validation of both autolytic modules,
            it is of utmost importance to assess the protein release capacity.
          </p>
          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            In order to verify whether the FLSA/LLSA autolytic system can release the target proteins to the
            extracellular environment, we tried to optimize the gene sequences within the E. coli autolytic system.
            Using different signal peptide, linker and T7 lysozyme sequences, we assembled and constructed four
            composite parts BBa_K5136221, BBa_K5136222, BBa_K5136220, BBa_K5136223, which were assembled into the
            expression vector pSB1C3 by standard assembly serving as the correct autolytic plasmid. Besides, we
            constructed a base part BBa_K5136028 as a reporter gene and then assembled it into the expression vector
            pET-28a(+) by standard assembly, serving as the reporter plasmid (sfgfp_pET-28a(+), laboratory stock).
          </p>
          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            Afterward, we co-transformed the reporter plasmid and the correct autolytic plasmid into E. coli BL21(DE3),
            and the cultures were grown overnight in the LB medium containing corresponding antibiotics. When the OD600
            value reaches 0.6-0.8, added 0.5 mM IPTG to induce sfGFP expression at 18°C. After 10 hours, 0.25%
            L-arabinose was added to activate the autolytic system. The total fluorescence intensity was measured after
            16 h of expression of the induced autolytic system, and the fluorescence intensity of the supernatant was
            measured too. The ratio of the fluorescence intensity of the culture and supernatant was used to assess the
            lysis efficiency of the FLSA system.

          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            As shown in Figure 19, the ratio of supernatant fluorescence intensity to total fluorescence intensity in
            the experiment group (BBa_K5136221, BBa_K5136222, BBa_K5136220, and BBa_K5136223) was significantly higher
            than that of the control group, demonstrating that the autolytic system FLSA/LLSA can release target
            proteins into the extracellular environment efficiently. Moreover, we achieved effective protein release by
            optimizing the structural combinations of our autolytic system FLSA/LLSA. (please see Engineering Success

            The LMT sequence has been identified as a signal peptide capable of directing recombinant proteins out of
            bacterial cells (XMU-China 2021). Given the variety of engineered signal peptides and corresponding
            translocation systems developed for secretory production of heterologous proteins in E. coli (1), we sought
            to compare the performance of the LMT sequence against other commonly used signal peptides. Specifically,
            several signal peptides or translocation systems associated with the Type II Secretion System
            (T2SS)—including both the Sec-dependent system and the Twin-Arginine Translocation (TAT) system—as well as
            the Type I Secretion System (T1SS), were selected and fused to the reporter protein sfGFP. The sequences of
            the various signal peptides are provided in Table 1. Most of the secretion systems utilized in this
            comparative analysis contain critical N-terminal regions necessary for recognition and function within the
            translocation machinery (2), which resulted in N-terminal fusions with sfGFP. However, the HlyABD secretion
            system, which belongs to T1SS, requires the C-terminal sequence of HlyA, as well as the heterologous
            expression of HlyB and HlyD as assistants (3, 4). Therefore, a C-terminal fusion of sfGFP with HlyA was
            constructed.

            All signal peptide-sfGFP fusions were expressed under the control of the T7 promoter on the pET-28a(+)

            intensity of the culture, the supernatant after centrifugation, and the OD600 of each group over time.
            Secretion efficiency was calculated at each sampling point as the ratio of fluorescence intensity of

            Our results revealed that both OsmY- and HlyA-mediated secretion, with the assistance of HlyB and HlyD,
            exhibited higher secretion efficiencies than any other signal peptides, including the newly discovered LMT
            sequence, which ranked third. YebF also performed well in the comparison (Figure 20A). Most of the other
            signal peptides exhibited secretion efficiencies below 2.5%. These findings demonstrate the variability in
            secretion efficiencies among different signal peptides, despite the long-term usage of some of them (1).
          </p>
          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            Interestingly, certain groups showed lower calculated secretion efficiencies than the sfGFP control group
            (which lacked a signal peptide, No SP). This may be due to the rapid growth and high levels of cytoplasmic
            sfGFP expression driven by the strong T7 promoter in E. coli BL21(DE3) (5). The normalized fluorescence
            intensity of the sfGFP-only (No SP) culture was much higher than that of sfGFP fusions with signal peptides,
            suggesting that even minor leakage due to cell growth or lysis contributed significantly to the fluorescence
            intensity in the supernatant (Figure 20 B). In the case of the LMT signal peptide, despite producing only
            half the total sfGFP as the no-signal-peptide group (No SP), the fluorescence intensity in the supernatant
            was comparable to that of the control group and significantly higher than that of any other signal peptide
            after 10 hours of induction. This highlights the LMT sequence's efficiency in exporting recombinant proteins
            out of the bacterial cells.
          </p>
          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            While OsmY- and HlyA-mediated secretion showed the highest secretion efficiencies, they also impaired cell
            growth (reflected by the lowest OD600 values) and reduced the normalized fluorescence intensity in the
            culture (Figure 20B). This indicates that overexpression of these systems places a metabolic burden on the
            host cells, possibly explaining the larger error bars associated with their calculated secretion
            efficiencies (Figure 20A). Additionally, the normalized fluorescence intensities in all groups with signal
            peptides were reduced (Figure 20B), potentially due to adverse effects on sfGFP folding caused by the fusion
            with signal peptides (6).
          </p>
          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            Classic signal peptides such as PelB and TorA, which direct recombinant proteins to the periplasmic space,
            exhibited relatively low efficiency for extracellular translocation (Figure 20A) (7). Similarly, OmpA,
            another well-known signal peptide, showed poor efficiency for recombinant protein secretion, unlike YebF and
            OsmY, which also mediate extracellular expression (8). Notably, the artificial intelligence-generated signal
            peptide AIgen, which functions efficiently in Bacillus subtilis, performed poorly in exporting recombinant
            proteins from E. coli (Figure 20A) (9). However, the OD600 values for the AIgen group suggested no
            significant growth burden (Figure 20B).

          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            In summary, our self-discovered LMT signal peptide showed a slight growth defect but achieved considerable
            secretion efficiency for the extracellular expression of recombinant proteins, making it a competitive
            alternative compared to other commonly used signal peptides in E. coli.

            We have proved that some CYP199A4 mutants showed stronger deinking, and LMT showed a good secretion effect.
            So, we try to verify the deinking efficiency of CYP199A4 mutants secreted to the supernatant by the LMT. The
            engineered bacteria were cultured at 25°C, and the supernatant culture was taken at 12 h, 18 h, 24 h, and 36
            h, respectively, using SDS-PAGE to demonstrate that the fusion protein could be successfully secreted into
            the supernatant. Gray scale value analysis was performed on the bands, proving that the concentration of
            LMT-CYP199A4 T253E in the culture supernatant gradually increased with time (Figure 23A). At the same time,
            the supernatant from the culture in 36 hours was used for the pulp deinking experiment (see SOP for more
            details), and the results are shown in Figure 23B. As shown in the picture from the microscope, LMT-CYP199A4
            T253E in the supernatant showed a perfect deinking effect. <b>The above results showed that the LMT signal
