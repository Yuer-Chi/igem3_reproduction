          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            Deinking is the bottleneck for waste paper recycling, which requires a substantial amount of toxic
            chemicals. It also releases poisonous organic agents and heavy metals that may cause environmental
            contamination and expensive disposal costs.</p>
          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            Our project, REPARO, focuses on developing an unprecedented solution based on synthetic biology, which could
            serve as a viable alternative to the chemical method on the industry scale. We have successfully established
            a screening method for enzymes with high deinking efficiency based on the gray scale changes.
            Leveraging the monooxygenase CYP199A4 and its mutants reported in the literature, we have identified a
            monooxygenase with high efficiency in deinking, a significant milestone in the wastepaper recycling process.
            This, combined with a rapid screening method, structure-activity analysis, and saturation mutation, has led
            us to the CYP199A4 mutant T253A, which exhibits superior deinking performance. By characterizing classic
            signal peptides, we proved that LMT has a high secretion efficiency. It realized the continuous secretion of
            CYP199A4 T253E with significant deinking performance. Furthermore, we expanded the application in erasing
            the handwriting based on the combination of crosslinked chitosan and rhamnolipid. Beyond that, displaying
            the metallothioneins on the surface of engineered bacteria could successfully reduce the heavy metal ion
            Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>2-</sup> in the wastewater. Finally, we proved that the scheme we designed
            is reasonable and feasible, which
            paves the way for its application at an industrial scale.

          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            The deinking blank system consisted of a 50 mL pulp with 1 g Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>, and 1.67 mL
            H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Ref.), which is same
            in each deinking method. Pulp was produced by the paper that printed the same article, ensuring the same ink
            concentration. The pulp preparation referred to standard operating procedure (see <a
              style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: none;" href="{{ url_for('pages', page='sop') }}">SOP</a> for
            more details).
            Then, limonene (see <a style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: none;"

              href="{{ url_for('pages', page='human-practices') }}">IHP</a> for more details) was selected from many
            hydrophobic solvents to extract
            the ink from the mixture after the reaction. The suction filtration was carried out through the Büchner
            funnel to remove the water and dry it in ovens. Take a picture for the paper cake after drying, and read the
            gray scale through the written program by automatically selecting (see <a
              style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: none;" href="{{ url_for('pages', page='sop') }}">SOP</a> for
            more details). These
            processes were summarized to a standard operating procedure (see <a
              style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: none;" href="{{ url_for('pages', page='sop') }}">SOP</a> for
            more details). It was worth noting
            that the higher the gray scale, the better the deinking effect. The experimental results showed that the
            deinking effect was almost invalid for <b>the deinking blank system, which was set as the negative
              control</b>.

            selected as a positive control. In the chemical method, 1 g NaOH was added to the deinking blank system and

            the optimal temperature of cellulase (60 °C) varies from that of P450 (30 °C), for the other combination, we
            first added 1 mL cellulase (0.2 mg/mL) to the deinking blank system and reacted at 60 °C for 60 min. After
            the reaction, 1 mL P450 (0.35 mg/mL) was added and reacted at 30 °C for 60 min. After the standard operating
            procedure (see <a style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: none;"
              href="{{ url_for('pages', page='sop') }}">SOP</a> for more details), read the gray scale
            automatically. The experimental results
            showed that there was no obvious improvement in the gray scale in the two multienzymes compared with
            that of a single enzyme. We found that gray scale of waste paper treated by monooxygenase was the
            highest one among the enzymes. Therefore, we hope to conduct further research on monooxygenase to optimize
            the deinking effect of waste paper enzymes.

            NADPH is an expensive coenzyme (428.7 $/g), which propels us to give up the way to use the NADPH-dependent
            P450 in the waste paper deinking. After reviewing the literature, we chose three kinds of monooxygenases,
            CYP199A4, OleT<sub>JE</sub> and SfmD and their mutants, which use H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as an electron
            donor. The targeted sequence was
            inserted in pET-28a(+) to construct circuits, which were transformed into <i>E. coli</i> BL21(DE3) to
            express each
            enzyme. The positive transformants were confirmed by kanamycin, colony PCR, and sequencing. After being
            cultivated and induced by 0.5 mM IPTG at 20 °C, the induction of CYP199A4 requires the addition of
            δ-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride (0.5 mM), the GE AKTA Prime Plus FPLC System was employed to get
            purified protein from the lysate supernatant. SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining were used to verify the
            expression of the target protein.

            with the best deinking effect. The step for circuit construction, induced expression, and protein

            Based on the results from the preliminary experiment, many enzymes exhibit excellent deinking performance,

          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            Protein purification was a tedious procedure that also cost a lot of money. We attempted to construct
            engineered bacteria based on synthetic biology to address the release of target proteins, which could skip
            the protein purification step. Therefore, we obtained a modified LLSA system (please see Design and
            Engineering Success for details) from the <i>E. coli</i> autolytic system FLSA (FhuD-T7 lysozyme-SsrA
            mediated
            autolytic system) (1). The system is designed to ensure that the target proteins can be efficiently produced
            and smoothly released outside the cell, thus simplifying the process of obtaining the target proteins and
            decreasing the treatment process cost (FLSA) (1). For the functional validation of both autolytic modules,
            it is of utmost importance to assess the protein release capacity.

          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            In order to verify whether the FLSA/LLSA autolytic system can release the target proteins to the
            extracellular environment, we tried to optimize the gene sequences within the <i>E. coli</i> autolytic
            system.
            Using different signal peptide, linker and T7 lysozyme sequences, we assembled and constructed four

            assembled it into the expression vector
            pET-28a(+) by standard assembly, serving as the reporter plasmid (<i>sfgfp</i>_pET-28a(+), laboratory
            stock).
          </p>
          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            Afterward, we co-transformed the reporter plasmid and the correct autolytic plasmid into <i>E. coli</i>

            and the cultures were grown overnight in the LB medium containing corresponding antibiotics. When the
            OD<sub>600</sub>
            value reaches 0.6-0.8, added 0.5 mM IPTG to induce sfGFP expression at 18 °C. After 10 h, 0.25%
            L-arabinose was added to activate the autolytic system. The total fluorescence intensity was measured after
            16 h of expression of the induced autolytic system, and the fluorescence intensity of the supernatant was
            measured too. The ratio of the fluorescence intensity of the culture and supernatant was used to assess the
            lysis efficiency of the FLSA system.

            The LMT sequence has been identified as a signal peptide capable of directing recombinant proteins out of
            bacterial cells (<a style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: none;"
              href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:XMU-China">XMU-China 2021</a>). Given the variety of engineered signal
            peptides and corresponding
            translocation systems developed for secretory production of heterologous proteins in <i>E. coli</i> (1), we
            sought
            to compare the performance of the LMT sequence against other commonly used signal peptides. Specifically,
            several signal peptides or translocation systems associated with the Type II Secretion System
            (T2SS)—including both the Sec-dependent system and the Twin-Arginine Translocation (TAT) system—as well as
            the Type I Secretion System (T1SS), were selected and fused to the reporter protein sfGFP. The sequences of
            the various signal peptides are provided in Table 1. Most of the secretion systems utilized in this
            comparative analysis contain critical N-terminal regions necessary for recognition and function within the
            translocation machinery (2), which resulted in N-terminal fusions with sfGFP. However, the HlyABD secretion
            system, which belongs to T1SS, requires the C-terminal sequence of HlyA, as well as the heterologous
            expression of HlyB and HlyD as assistants (3, 4). Therefore, a C-terminal fusion of sfGFP with HlyA was
            constructed.

            intensity of the culture, the supernatant after centrifugation, and the OD<sub>600</sub> of each group over

            Our results revealed that both OsmY- and HlyA-mediated secretion, with the assistance of HlyB and HlyD,
            exhibited higher secretion efficiencies than any other signal peptides, including the newly discovered LMT
            sequence, which ranked third. YebF also performed well in the comparison (Figure 20A). Most of the other
            signal peptides exhibited secretion efficiencies below 2.5%. These findings demonstrate the variability in
            secretion efficiencies among different signal peptides, despite the long-term usage of some of them (1).
          </p>
          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            Interestingly, certain groups showed lower calculated secretion efficiencies than the sfGFP control group
            (which lacked a signal peptide, No SP). This may be due to the rapid growth and high levels of cytoplasmic
            sfGFP expression driven by the strong T7 promoter in <i>E. coli</i> BL21(DE3) (5). The normalized
            fluorescence
            intensity of the sfGFP-only (No SP) culture was much higher than that of sfGFP fusions with signal peptides,
            suggesting that even minor leakage due to cell growth or lysis contributed significantly to the fluorescence
            intensity in the supernatant (Figure 20 B). In the case of the LMT signal peptide, despite producing only
            half the total sfGFP as the no-signal-peptide group (No SP), the fluorescence intensity in the supernatant
            was comparable to that of the control group and significantly higher than that of any other signal peptide
            after 10 h of induction. This highlights the LMT sequence's efficiency in exporting recombinant proteins
            out of the bacterial cells.
          </p>
          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            While OsmY- and HlyA-mediated secretion showed the highest secretion efficiencies, they also impaired cell
            growth (reflected by the lowest OD<sub>600</sub> values) and reduced the normalized fluorescence intensity
            in the
            culture (Figure 20B). This indicates that overexpression of these systems places a metabolic burden on the
            host cells, possibly explaining the larger error bars associated with their calculated secretion
            efficiencies (Figure 20A). Additionally, the normalized fluorescence intensities in all groups with signal
            peptides were reduced (Figure 20B), potentially due to adverse effects on sfGFP folding caused by the fusion
            with signal peptides (6).
          </p>
          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            Classic signal peptides such as PelB and TorA, which direct recombinant proteins to the periplasmic space,
            exhibited relatively low efficiency for extracellular translocation (Figure 20A) (7). Similarly, OmpA,
            another well-known signal peptide, showed poor efficiency for recombinant protein secretion, unlike YebF and
            OsmY, which also mediate extracellular expression (8). Notably, the artificial intelligence-generated signal
            peptide AIgen, which functions efficiently in Bacillus subtilis, performed poorly in exporting recombinant
            proteins from <i>E. coli</i> (Figure 20A) (9). However, the OD<sub>600</sub> values for the AIgen group
            suggested no
            significant growth burden (Figure 20B).

          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            In summary, our self-discovered LMT signal peptide showed a slight growth defect but achieved considerable
            secretion efficiency for the extracellular expression of recombinant proteins, making it a competitive
            alternative compared to other commonly used signal peptides in <i>E. coli</i>.

            the fluorescence intensity of the resuspension sample in the experimental group (INPNC-His
            tag-SpyCatcher_pSB1C3) was significantly higher than that of the control group (I0500_pSB1C3). In addition,
            we can also observe significant fluorescence from precipitation in the experiment group, while the control
            group was contrary (Figure 27). These results indicated the combination between HisTag-SpyTag-GFP and the
            INPNC-HisTag-SpyCatcher displayed on the surface of <i>E. coli</i> BL21(DE3), demonstrating that INPNC
            exhibits

            In our REPARO project, we designed and developed an unprecedented deinking method based on synthetic
            biology, which could serve as a viable alternative to the chemical method on the industry scale. The
            implementation of our REPARO project holds immense potential to propel technological advancement and
            industrial upgrading within the waste paper recycling industry. Our project aims to introduce advanced
            biotechnology and environmental protection concepts to enhance the entire industry's production efficiency,
            product quality, and environmental protection level, thereby strengthening the industry's competitiveness

          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            In the foreseeable future, we aim to comprehensively characterize the deinking efficacy achieved through the
            synergistic use of diverse deinking enzymes and explore the optimal conditions that maximize the performance
            of each enzyme. Concurrently, we aim to validate the deinking capabilities further when our autolytic system
            is integrated with deinking enzymes, and verify the deinking capabilities of the exogenous secretion system,
            activated by the Anderson promoter, in conjunction with these enzymes. Importantly, we are committed to
            continuously optimizing the design and verification processes of our erasing product, demonstrating our
            dedication to the creation of a convenient, efficient, and practical erasing product for everyday use.
