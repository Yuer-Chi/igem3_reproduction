          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            Deinking is the bottleneck for waste paper recycling, which requires a substantial amount of toxic
            chemicals. It also releases poisonous organic agents and heavy metals that may cause environmental
            contamination and expensive disposal costs.
            Our project, REPARO, focuses on developing an unprecedented solution based on synthetic biology, which could
            serve as a viable alternative to the chemical method on the industry scale. We have successfully established
            a screening method for enzymes with high deinking efficiency based on the grayscale value changes.
            Leveraging the monooxygenase CYP199A4 and its mutants reported in the literature, we have identified a
            monooxygenase with high efficiency in deinking, a significant milestone in the wastepaper recycling process.
            This, combined with a rapid screening method, structure-activity analysis, and saturation mutation, has led
            us to the CYP199A4 mutant T253A, which exhibits superior deinking performance. By characterizing classic
            signal peptides, we proved that LMT has a high secretion efficiency. It realized the continuous secretion of
            CYP199A4 T253E with significant deinking performance. Furthermore, we expanded the application in erasing
            the handwriting based on the combination of crosslinked chitosan and rhamnolipid. Beyond that, displaying
            the metallothioneins on the surface of engineered bacteria could successfully reduce the heavy metal ion
            Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>2-</sup> in the wastewater. Finally, we proved that the scheme we designed
            is reasonable and feasible, which
            paves the way for its application at an industrial scale.

          <p class="myPage-paragraph-content">
            The deinking blank system consisted of a 50 mL pulp with 1 g Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>, and 1.67 mL
            H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Ref.), which is same
            in each deinking method. Pulp was produced by the paper that printed the same article, ensuring the same ink
            concentration. The pulp preparation referred to standard operating procedure (see <a
              style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: none;" href="{{ url_for('pages', page='sop') }}">SOP</a> for
            more details).
            Then, limonene (see <a style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: none;"

            hydrophobic solvents to extract
            the ink from the mixture after the reaction. The suction filtration was carried out through the Buchner
            funnel to remove the water and dry it in ovens. Take a picture for the paper cake after drying, and read the
            gray value through the written program by automatically selecting (see <a
              style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: none;" href="{{ url_for('pages', page='sop') }}">SOP</a> for

            processes were summarized to a standard operating procedure (see <a
              style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: none;" href="{{ url_for('pages', page='sop') }}">SOP</a> for
            more details). It was worth noting
            that the higher the gray value, the better the deinking effect. The experimental results showed that the

            the reaction, 1 mL P450 (0.35 mg/mL) was added and reacted at 30 °C for 60 min. After the standard operating
            procedure (see <a style="font-weight: bolder;text-decoration: none;"
              href="{{ url_for('pages', page='sop') }}">SOP</a> for more details), read the gray scale value
            automatically. The experimental results
            showed that there was no obvious improvement in the gray scale value in the two multienzymes compared with
            that of a single enzyme. We found that gray scale value of waste paper treated by monooxygenase was the
            highest one among the enzymes. Therefore, we hope to conduct further research on monooxygenase to optimize
            the deinking effect of waste paper enzymes.

            Based on the above experimental results, we found that monooxygenase plays an important role in the deinking
            of waste paper. Therefore, we hope to conduct further research on monooxygenase to optimize the deinking
            effect of waste paper.
